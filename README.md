The LIBFT project is a fundamental assignment in the 42 curriculum, where students build a custom C library from scratch. The goal is to replicate standard C library functions (like strlen, strcpy, etc.), along with additional utility functions to prepare students for advanced programming projects. It emphasizes understanding memory management, pointer manipulation, and implementing reusable code. LIBFT serves as a foundational tool, as students can use it in future projects. This project fosters strong coding discipline and familiarity with low-level programming concepts.
